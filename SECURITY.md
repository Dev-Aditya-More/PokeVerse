🧩 Overview

Pokéverse is a fan-made app that shows Pokémon details, abilities, and descriptions using the PokéAPI.
We don’t collect or store any personal user information — the app focuses on reading data from public APIs.

🧠 Basic Security Practices

The app only uses HTTPS (secure connections) when talking to any API.

No passwords or accounts are required to use the app.

Any cached Pokémon data is stored locally on the device and can be cleared anytime.

No sensitive data (like tokens or personal info) is saved or sent anywhere.

No ads or tracking are included in the current version.

🧱 Data & Storage

We only save small bits of data (like favorite Pokémon or cached lists) to improve loading speed.

Data is stored locally in the app’s private storage area — other apps can’t access it.

If you uninstall Pokéverse, all stored data is automatically deleted.

🧰 Dependencies

Pokéverse uses open-source libraries (Jetpack Compose, Coil, Koin, etc.).

These libraries are from trusted sources and kept up to date.

🚫 What We Don’t Do

We don’t collect analytics or usage data.

We don’t share any information with third parties.

We don’t store passwords, emails, or user profiles.
